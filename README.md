# Pomodoro Clock
## FCC Advanced Front End Development Projects - 2
### General Description
A pomodoro clock for productivity that runs for some amount of time (time to spend working) and then some other amount of time (time off working) and repeats.

###Libraries
I intend to complete this project using only vanilla JS and no flexbox

### Functionality
* Counts down the "work" time, and then counts down the "break" time, and repeats
* Allows the work and break time values to be set. Changing these values resets and pauses the timer
* Clicking the timer pauses and starts the count

### Appearance
* Being lazy and using the same general layout as the FCC example.
* Measuring the countdown will track circularly around the button to track level of work-time completion, and then will retrace the circle to track break time.
